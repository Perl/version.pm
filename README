version 0.9929
==================================

Object oriented versions for all Perl releases from 5.6.2 onward.  Replaces
the core version code for all Perl releases from 5.10.0 onwards.

Although this code has been fully integrated into the latest Perl release
itself (e.g. bleadperl), the CPAN release is considered upstream.  The source
code itself is available from:

    https://github.com/Perl/version.pm

and a bug queue here:

   https://rt.cpan.org/Dist/Display.html?Queue=version

Patches welcomed.

IMPORTANT NOTE - 0.9906 is the last release that fully supports Perl
releases prior to 5.6.2.  It is just too much trouble to continue to
fight to maintain full backward compatibility.

YOU SHOULD INSTALL THIS RELEASE WHEN USING VERSION OBJECTS IN PERL 5.10.0.
There was a bug caused by objects serialized by YAML that will cause Perl
5.10.0 to segfault.  As long as some module calls 'use version', then the
replacement code will take effect and Perl will not crash.

Please read the POD documentation for usage/details.  See the CHANGES file
for full details of all changes to the module behavior.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   $ perl Makefile.PL
   $ make
   $ make test
   # make install

This release includes an optional pure Perl implementation (in case
you don't have a C-compiler or if some reason you want your code to be
much slower).  You can test it by replacing the first line above with:

   $ perl Makefile.PL --perl_only

and it will install the Perl only version.

DEPENDENCIES

The same C compiler used to build Perl (or not).
